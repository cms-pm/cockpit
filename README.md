# Cockpit Project

Cockpit is an embedded hypervisor project that provides a lightweight virtual machine (VM) environment for running bytecode programs on microcontrollers. Currently targeting ARM Cortex-M4 platforms, with a focus on Arduino-compatible hardware abstraction.

## Vision

The Cockpit project aims to create a versatile platform for embedded applications, enabling hardware abstraction and simplified embedded development through a stack-based virtual machine.

## Current Implementation (Phase 2.1 Complete)

### **Core Features Implemented**

*   **Virtual Machine Core:** 16-bit bytecode instruction set with stack-based operations (PUSH, POP, ADD, SUB, MUL, DIV, HALT).
*   **Arduino API Integration:** Five core Arduino functions (digitalWrite, digitalRead, analogWrite, analogRead, delay) implemented as VM opcodes.
*   **Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL):** GPIO abstraction for ARM Cortex-M4 (Stellaris LM3S6965EVB) with pin mapping and digital operations.
*   **Memory Management:** 8KB RAM allocation for VM stack and heap with bounds checking and overflow protection.
*   **QEMU Development Environment:** Automated testing and debugging with ARM semihosting support for hardware-independent development.
*   **Build System:** PlatformIO integration with automated compilation and testing pipeline.
*   **Comprehensive Testing:** 39 unit tests covering VM core operations and Arduino GPIO functionality (89% pass rate).

### **Technical Specifications**

*   **Flash Usage:** 6,640 bytes (5.1% of 128KB)
*   **RAM Usage:** 24 bytes static (0.1% of 20KB) + 8KB VM memory
*   **Instruction Format:** 8-bit opcode + 8-bit immediate value
*   **Supported Operations:** Stack manipulation, arithmetic, digital GPIO, basic analog operations
*   **Target Platform:** ARM Cortex-M4 with QEMU emulation support

## Planned Features

The following features represent future development phases and are not yet implemented:

### **Advanced VM Capabilities**
*   **CALL/RET Operations:** Function call support with return address management
*   **Memory Protection Unit (MPU):** Hardware-based memory protection for ARM Cortex-M4
*   **Multi-Architecture Support:** RISC-V and 8051 microcontroller targets
*   **Interrupt Handling:** VM-level interrupt service routines and event processing

### **Dynamic Updates and Remote Management**
*   **Over-the-Air (OTA) Updates:** Remote bytecode deployment and firmware updates
*   **Remote Orchestration:** Network-based device control and configuration management
*   **Bootloader Integration:** Secure loading and updating of bytecode programs
*   **Version Management:** Bytecode versioning and compatibility validation

### **Telemetry and Communication**
*   **Telemetry Collection:** Performance monitoring and system health data gathering
*   **Network Stack:** TCP/IP, WiFi, and cellular communication protocols
*   **Data Transmission:** JSON/protobuf serialization for remote data exchange
*   **Communication Protocols:** MQTT, HTTP, and custom protocols for IoT integration

### **Production Features**
*   **Advanced Peripheral Support:** I2C, SPI, UART, PWM, and ADC hardware drivers
*   **Power Management:** Sleep modes, wake-on-interrupt, and power optimization
*   **Security Features:** Encryption, authentication, and secure boot mechanisms
*   **Watchdog and Reliability:** System monitoring and fault recovery mechanisms

### **Development Tools**
*   **C/C++ to Bytecode Compiler:** Direct compilation from high-level code to VM bytecode
*   **Hardware-in-the-Loop Testing:** Real hardware validation and performance measurement
*   **Performance Profiling:** Cycle-accurate timing analysis and optimization tools
*   **CI/CD Pipeline:** Automated testing and deployment infrastructure
