# Cortex-M4 MPU in STM32G4: Architecture to Hypervisor Implementation

The ARM Cortex-M4 Memory Protection Unit (MPU) represents a fundamental shift from traditional memory management approaches, trading the complexity of virtual memory for deterministic, zero-latency protection that's perfectly suited for embedded hypervisor implementations. **Unlike MMU-based systems that translate addresses through page tables, the Cortex-M4 MPU operates on physical addresses using configurable regions**<sup>[1][2]</sup>, making it both simpler and more predictable for real-time applications. The STM32G4 implementation provides a complete reference for understanding how MPU-based hypervisors can achieve robust memory isolation in resource-constrained environments.

## Core architectural foundations versus traditional approaches

The Cortex-M4 MPU fundamentally differs from Memory Management Units (MMUs) in both philosophy and implementation. Where MMUs create virtual address spaces through complex page table hierarchies, **the MPU divides physical memory into up to 8 configurable regions with direct address mapping**<sup>[2][3]</sup>. This region-based approach eliminates the Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB) complexity found in Cortex-A processors, providing zero-latency memory protection checks that occur in parallel with normal memory accesses.

The architectural elegance lies in its simplicity: each region is defined by a base address, size (power-of-two from 32 bytes to 4GB), and attribute set. Unlike MMU systems where page faults can trigger complex address translation sequences, **MPU violations generate immediate MemManage exceptions with precise fault addresses**<sup>[4][5]</sup>. This predictable behavior makes it ideal for safety-critical embedded systems where timing determinism is paramount.

The ARMv7-M Protected Memory System Architecture (PMSA) ensures that protection checks integrate seamlessly with the processor pipeline. The MPU examines every memory access against all enabled regions, with higher-numbered regions taking precedence over lower-numbered ones in overlapping scenarios. This priority system enables sophisticated protection schemes while maintaining the simple programming model.

## STM32G4 implementation specifics and memory architecture

STMicroelectronics implements the standard Cortex-M4 MPU specification exactly in the STM32G4 series, with no architectural deviations. **The key STM32G4-specific advantage lies in the Core-Coupled Memory (CCM) SRAM architecture**<sup>[6][7]</sup>, which provides zero wait-state execution when properly configured with the MPU.

The STM32G4 memory map presents unique opportunities for hypervisor implementations. The CCM SRAM at 0x1000_0000 (up to 32KB in STM32G47x/G48x devices) can be accessed directly by the CPU without DMA interference, making it ideal for hypervisor code and critical data structures. **Contrasting with regular SRAM at 0x2000_0000, the CCM provides both superior performance and natural isolation from DMA-based attacks**<sup>[7][8]</sup>.

The STM32G4's CCM aliasing capability adds another layer of flexibility. While the primary CCM address provides optimal performance characteristics, the aliased addresses (0x2000_5800 for STM32G431, 0x2001_8000 for STM32G47x) enable contiguous address space management. However, **the performance characteristics differ between these mappings—the primary address offers zero wait-state access while the aliased address follows normal SRAM timing**.

STM32G4 devices support additional protection through the SYSCFG_SWPR register, which provides 1KB-granularity write protection for CCM SRAM. This hardware feature complements MPU protection by creating dual-layer security for hypervisor-critical data structures.

## Region configuration and attribute management

MPU regions require careful configuration to maximize protection effectiveness within the eight-region constraint. **Each region must be naturally aligned to its size boundary and sized as a power-of-two**, creating a constraint that differs sharply from MMU systems where 4KB page granularity provides more flexibility.

The region attribute system provides sophisticated control over memory behavior. The Access Permission (AP) field enables fine-grained privilege control: value 001 restricts access to privileged code only, 010 allows privileged read/write with unprivileged read-only access, while 011 provides full access to both privilege levels. **The Execute Never (XN) bit prevents code execution from data regions, a critical defense against code injection attacks that's often overlooked in traditional embedded designs**<sup>[9][10]</sup>.

Memory type attributes profoundly impact both security and performance. Normal memory allows processor optimizations like instruction reordering and caching, Device memory enforces strictly ordered access for peripheral regions, while Strongly Ordered memory provides the most restrictive access pattern for synchronization primitives. **The TEX, C, and B fields work together to define caching and buffering policies—misconfiguration here can either compromise security or severely degrade performance**.

Subregions provide additional granularity for regions larger than 256 bytes. Each region can be divided into eight equal subregions, with individual subregions disabled through the SRD field. This capability proves invaluable for hypervisor implementations where guest memory allocations don't perfectly align with power-of-two boundaries.

## Privilege levels and memory access control

The Cortex-M4's two-level privilege model—Thread and Handler modes—integrates seamlessly with MPU protection. **Thread mode can operate in either privileged or unprivileged states, while Handler mode (interrupt and exception processing) always executes with full privileges**. This asymmetric design enables hypervisors to maintain system stability while restricting guest code execution.

The MPU_CTRL.PRIVDEFENA bit controls a critical aspect of privilege handling. When enabled, it allows privileged code to access the default memory map for unmapped regions, providing backward compatibility with existing code. **When disabled, all unmapped accesses generate faults regardless of privilege level—a setting that enables complete memory access control for secure hypervisor implementations**.

Fault handling reveals the MPU's sophisticated privilege awareness. MemManage faults provide detailed information about violation type through the Memory Management Fault Status Register (MMFSR). The IACCVIOL bit indicates instruction access violations, DACCVIOL identifies data access violations, while MSTKERR and MUNSTKERR flag exception stacking errors. **This precise fault information enables hypervisors to implement sophisticated guest program debugging and security monitoring**.

The fault address register (MMFAR) captures the exact address that triggered a violation when MMARVALID is set, providing hypervisors with the information needed for precise fault attribution and recovery. This contrasts with some simpler protection mechanisms that only provide general fault indications without specific location data.

## Hypervisor memory isolation strategies

MPU-based hypervisors represent a significant departure from traditional MMU-based virtualization approaches. **Research from George Washington University demonstrates that complete virtualization is achievable on MPU-based microcontrollers through innovative memory management techniques**<sup>[11]</sup>. Their Path-Compressed Radix Tries (PCTries) approach generalizes memory protection to support dynamic memory mapping while maintaining the predictable MPU programming model.

The fundamental challenge in MPU-based hypervisors lies in the limited number of regions versus the need to isolate multiple guests. Traditional approaches might dedicate regions per guest, quickly exhausting the available eight regions. **Instead, successful implementations use Memory Protection Arrays (MPAs) and template-based region management to achieve effective virtualization with up to 8 virtual machines on 512KB SRAM systems**.

Template systems define standard region sets for common guest configurations—code regions with execute permissions but no write access, data regions with read/write permissions but no execute capability, and stack regions with strict boundary enforcement. **The auxiliary slot management technique increases effective MPU capacity by dynamically swapping regions for I/O peripheral access, dramatically expanding the apparent number of available regions**.

ARM's Cortex-R52+ processor introduces advanced MPU capabilities specifically designed for hypervisor support, featuring Exception Level architecture with separate EL2 (Hypervisor) and EL1 (OS) MPUs. This two-stage protection model provides hardware-enforced hypervisor isolation while maintaining guest OS protection capabilities, contrasting with the single-level protection available in Cortex-M4 systems.

## Guest program memory constraints and isolation

Constraining guest programs to assigned stack and heap memory slices requires sophisticated region management strategies. **The key insight is that power-of-two alignment constraints can be turned into advantages through careful memory layout algorithms**. Research shows that greedy heuristic algorithms can achieve approximately 50% memory efficiency while maintaining strong isolation boundaries.

Stack protection in hypervisor environments goes beyond simple guard pages. **MPU-based systems replace traditional red zone concepts with full stack region protection, providing immediate fault generation on stack overflow or underflow**. Stack regions are typically configured with read/write permissions and execute-never attributes, placed in high-priority MPU slots to prevent guest code from overriding protection settings.

Heap management presents unique challenges in MPU-based systems due to alignment requirements. **Dynamic memory allocation must consider region boundaries and power-of-two sizing constraints, often leading to internal fragmentation that must be balanced against security requirements**. Successful implementations use memory pools aligned to MPU region boundaries, enabling efficient region-based protection of heap allocations.

The component isolation model implemented in research systems provides strong inter-guest protection. Each component encapsulates code, data, and thread execution contexts with capability tables controlling access to system resources. **This approach enables user-level memory management through memory retyping operations while maintaining hypervisor-enforced isolation boundaries**.

## Practical hypervisor configuration examples

Real-world hypervisor implementations require careful orchestration of MPU regions to achieve effective isolation. A typical STM32G4-based hypervisor configuration might allocate regions as follows:

Region 0 establishes the foundation with flash memory protection configured for 512KB with read-only access and cacheable attributes. This region prevents guest code modification while enabling efficient instruction fetching. **The configuration uses AP=110 (read-only for all privilege levels) combined with execute permission and cache-friendly memory attributes**.

Region 1 protects the hypervisor's CCM SRAM, typically configured as a 32KB region at 0x1000_0000 with full access for privileged code only (AP=001). **This region uses TEX=001, C=0, B=0 to provide non-cacheable, non-bufferable access suitable for time-critical hypervisor operations**. The execute-never bit is cleared to allow hypervisor code execution from CCM for maximum performance.

Regions 2-6 provide dynamic guest isolation, with base addresses and sizes updated during context switches. Each guest receives dedicated stack and data regions with appropriate access permissions. **Stack regions use execute-never attributes (XN=1) while data regions might combine read/write access with execute-never to prevent code injection attacks**.

Region 7, having the highest priority, serves as a security override region. This region can temporarily restrict access to critical system resources during sensitive operations, **providing a mechanism for implementing atomic security operations that cannot be interrupted by guest code**.

The configuration sequence requires careful attention to instruction ordering. Memory barriers (__DSB() and __ISB()) ensure that MPU configuration changes take effect before subsequent code execution, preventing race conditions that could compromise security.

## Performance implications and optimization strategies

MPU-based hypervisors achieve remarkably good performance characteristics compared to traditional embedded virtualization approaches. **Research demonstrates approximately 2x overhead compared to bare metal execution, with interrupt latencies remaining under 5% for typical I/O rates**<sup>[11]</sup>—significantly better than MMU-based systems where TLB misses can cause unpredictable delays.

The key performance advantage lies in the zero-latency nature of MPU protection checks. Unlike MMU systems where address translation can stall the processor pipeline, **MPU checks occur in parallel with memory accesses, adding no additional clock cycles to normal memory operations**. This predictable behavior makes MPU-based hypervisors suitable for hard real-time applications where timing guarantees are essential.

Context switch performance benefits from the register-based MPU programming model. Multi-register load/store instructions can update multiple MPU regions efficiently, while summary maintenance in PCTrie heads enables fast context switching between guests. **Optimized implementations achieve context switch times comparable to traditional RTOS task switching, making the hypervisor overhead acceptable for many embedded applications**.

Memory attribute optimization plays a crucial role in overall system performance. Normal memory regions with appropriate caching policies provide the best performance for code and frequently accessed data. **Device memory regions enforce strongly ordered access for peripheral registers, preventing processor optimizations that could interfere with hardware behavior**. Strongly ordered memory provides the most restrictive access pattern for synchronization primitives where ordering guarantees are critical.

## Limitations and comparative analysis

MPU-based protection schemes face fundamental limitations compared to MMU-based approaches. **The eight-region constraint represents the most significant limitation, requiring sophisticated memory layout algorithms and dynamic region management to support complex applications**. MMU-based systems provide virtually unlimited protection domains through hierarchical page tables, contrasting sharply with the MPU's fixed region count.

The power-of-two sizing requirement creates internal fragmentation that doesn't exist in MMU systems with their fixed 4KB page size. **This constraint can lead to significant memory waste when protection requirements don't align with power-of-two boundaries**—a 1KB data structure might require a 2KB MPU region, wasting 50% of the allocated space.

Comparing with TrustZone-based protection reveals different security models entirely. TrustZone provides hardware-enforced secure and non-secure worlds with complete system isolation, while the MPU offers fine-grained memory region protection within a single security domain. **TrustZone excels at protecting cryptographic operations and secure boot processes, while the MPU provides better flexibility for general memory protection within the non-secure world**.

NoC-MPU architectures found in some advanced embedded systems provide hierarchical protection that combines network-on-chip isolation with MPU-based memory protection. **These systems offer parallel protocol conversion and distributed MPU checking, providing scalability beyond single-core MPU limitations while maintaining the deterministic timing characteristics that make MPU-based systems attractive**.

## Advanced considerations and future directions

The integration of MPU-based hypervisors with modern embedded security requirements points toward hybrid protection models. **Combining TrustZone's secure world isolation with MPU-based protection in the non-secure world provides both system-level security and fine-grained memory protection**. This approach enables secure boot and cryptographic operations in the secure world while supporting sophisticated hypervisor implementations in the non-secure world.

DMA protection represents an ongoing challenge for MPU-based systems. **While the MPU protects CPU-based memory accesses, DMA transfers can bypass MPU protection entirely**, requiring careful system design and potentially external memory protection units (MPUs) or system MMUs (SMMUs) for complete memory protection. Future embedded systems may integrate more sophisticated bus matrix protection to address this limitation.

The research trajectory points toward more intelligent memory layout optimization algorithms that can automatically optimize memory placement for MPU constraints. **Machine learning approaches might eventually enable dynamic memory layout optimization based on application behavior patterns**, maximizing both security and memory efficiency in MPU-constrained environments.

The proven viability of MPU-based hypervisors in resource-constrained environments opens new possibilities for secure embedded computing. **As IoT devices require increasing security and isolation capabilities, MPU-based approaches provide a practical path forward that balances security, performance, and resource efficiency**—making sophisticated virtualization accessible in environments where traditional MMU-based approaches would be prohibitively expensive in terms of power, area, and complexity.

The Cortex-M4 MPU in STM32G4 implementations thus represents not just a memory protection mechanism, but a foundation for next-generation embedded security architectures that can support multiple isolated execution domains within the constraints of embedded microcontroller systems.
