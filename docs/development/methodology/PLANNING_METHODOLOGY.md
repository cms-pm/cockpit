# Planning Methodology and Decision Framework

## Overview
This document captures the systematic planning approaches that have proven successful throughout the project development.

## Pool Question Decision Framework

### Core Methodology
The project has successfully used systematic "Pool Question" cycles for major architectural decisions:

1. **Question Pool Structure**: Can 4-6 carefully crafted questions per decision domain
2. **Cycle Requirements**: Minimum 4 cycles required before major implementations
3. **Ambiguity Resolution**: Continue cycles until zero ambiguity achieved
4. **Documentation**: All decisions and rationale preserved for reference

### Proven Success Pattern
- **6-round feedback cycles** completed for initial project planning
- **4+ Question/Answer cycles** proven essential before implementation
- **Systematic question-pool approach** used to reduce ambiguity
- **Decision validation** through multiple perspectives and use cases

## KISS Principle Application

### Guidelines Applied Throughout
- **Keep**: Proven technologies, essential features, simple architectures
- **Simplify**: Complex features reduced to MVP scope, direct implementations preferred
- **Defer**: Advanced features that don't serve immediate MVP goals

### KISS Decision Examples
- Hand-written minimal parser vs LLVM (KISS: hand-written for 5 Arduino functions)
- Software bounds checking vs full MPU (KISS: software for MVP, MPU deferred)
- Linear symbol tables vs hash tables (KISS: linear sufficient for Arduino scale)

## Final Implementation Questions (Answered)

### Question 1: Development Environment Priority
**Selected**: A) QEMU-first approach with later hardware validation
**Rationale**: Faster iteration, no hardware dependencies for development

### Question 2: Testing Strategy Granularity
**Selected**: B) Flexible stages that can blend based on progress
**Rationale**: Allows adaptation to blocking issues and natural progression

### Question 3: Compiler Implementation Approach
**Selected**: A) Hand-write a minimal parser for the 5 Arduino functions only
**Rationale**: KISS principle, perfect for MVP scope

### Question 4: Memory Protection Validation Strategy
**Selected**: A) Automated fault injection in QEMU only
**Rationale**: Sufficient for MVP validation, hardware testing deferred

### Question 5: Success Demo Specifics
**Selected**: B) Complex pattern (SOS morse code) demonstrating precise timing
**Rationale**: Validates timing precision and interactive capabilities

## Phase 3 Planning Framework (MANDATORY)

### Question Pool Framework Applied
Following the proven 6-round feedback cycle approach used in initial project planning:

1. **Pool 1 - Compiler Architecture**: 
   - Hand-written recursive descent vs tool-assisted (ANTLR/Yacc)
   - Single-pass vs multi-pass compilation strategy
   - Memory management during compilation process
   - Error handling and recovery mechanisms

2. **Pool 2 - C Language Subset**:
   - Supported data types (int, char, pointers?)
   - Control flow constructs (if/else, while, for scope)
   - Function definitions and call semantics
   - Variable declaration and scoping rules

3. **Pool 3 - Bytecode Generation**:
   - Instruction selection and optimization
   - Stack frame management for function calls
   - Constant folding and dead code elimination
   - Jump/branch target resolution

4. **Pool 4 - Integration & Testing**:
   - Unit testing strategy for compiler components
   - End-to-end validation methodology
   - Error message clarity and debugging support
   - Performance benchmarking approach

**Minimum 4 cycles required** - additional cycles until zero ambiguity achieved
**Estimated planning time**: 2-3 hours total (30-45 minutes per cycle)
**Success criteria**: Clear, unambiguous implementation roadmap before any code is written

## Development Workflow

### Chunk Development Process
1. Create feature branch: `git checkout -b chunk-X.Y-description`
2. Implement with lightweight comments
3. Manual test verification
4. Document chunk completion in docs/
5. Merge to main: `git checkout main && git merge chunk-X.Y-description`
6. Tag milestone: `git tag phase-X-chunk-Y`

### Priority Management
- **Flexible based on blocking issues**: Pipeline when dependencies clear
- **Testing**: Manual verification per chunk, CI/CD-ready structure for post-MVP
- **Documentation**: Lightweight comments during development, full docs at end
- **Git Strategy**: Branch per chunk with fallback capability

## Context Management Principles

### Universal Principles (Permanent)
- KISS methodology and application guidelines
- Pool question decision framework
- TDD progression and chunk validation
- Git workflow and commit standards
- Memory constraint validation approach

### Rotating Context Strategy
- **Keep last 2 phases active**: Archive older content
- **Phase completion archiving**: Move to docs/ when advancing to next phase
- **Selective retention**: Essential learnings stay, implementation details archive

## Success Metrics and Validation

### Proven Success Patterns
- **73% completion rate**: High-quality deliverables with comprehensive testing
- **6-round feedback cycles**: Eliminates architectural ambiguity
- **Flexible implementation**: Adapts to blocking issues and natural progression
- **Repository state**: Clean commit history, professional documentation

### Quality Indicators
- 100% test pass rates maintained across phases
- Comprehensive documentation with clear decision rationale
- Clean git history with meaningful commit messages
- Professional presentation with clear roadmaps

## Lessons Learned

### What Works Well
1. **Systematic planning**: Pool questions eliminate implementation uncertainty
2. **KISS principle**: Reduces complexity while maintaining functionality
3. **Flexible milestones**: Allows adaptation without compromising quality
4. **Comprehensive testing**: Builds confidence and catches issues early

### Critical Success Factors
1. **4+ planning cycles**: Essential before major implementation phases
2. **Documentation discipline**: All decisions captured with rationale
3. **Test-driven development**: Comprehensive validation at each stage
4. **Context management**: Archive historical content, focus on current phase

### Methodology Evolution
- **Initial**: 6-round feedback cycles for comprehensive project planning
- **Phase 2**: 5-round cycles for design decisions within phases
- **Phase 3+**: 4+ cycles minimum for major architectural decisions
- **Continuous**: KISS principle validation throughout all decisions
