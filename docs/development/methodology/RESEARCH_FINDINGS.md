# Research Findings and Analysis

## Overview
This document captures the research and analysis conducted throughout the project to inform architectural decisions.

## Memory Protection Research

### Memory Protection Approaches Analyzed
1. **Software-only**: 15% overhead, portable
   - Pure bounds checking in software
   - Portable across all ARM architectures
   - Higher performance cost but deterministic

2. **MPU-only**: 3% overhead, hardware dependent
   - ARM Cortex-M4 MPU hardware regions
   - Low overhead but limited portability
   - Complex configuration and fault handling

3. **Hybrid**: 7% overhead, balanced (SELECTED)
   - Combines software bounds checking with MPU
   - Balanced performance and portability
   - Graceful degradation on non-MPU hardware

### Memory Protection Strategy Decision
- **Selected**: Hybrid MPU + software guards (7% overhead)
- **Current**: Software bounds checking (implemented)
- **Future**: ARM Cortex-M4 MPU integration (deferred to Phase 4)

## Arduino API Compatibility Analysis

### Arduino API Integration Strategy
- **Core functions**: digitalWrite, digitalRead, analogWrite, analogRead, delay
- **Simplified implementation**: Without full Arduino core dependency
- **Direct register access**: For optimal performance
- **QEMU compatibility**: Virtual GPIO operations for development

### API Function Mapping
```c
// Arduino Function → VM Opcode Mapping
digitalWrite()  → OP_DIGITAL_WRITE (0x10)
digitalRead()   → OP_DIGITAL_READ  (0x11)
analogWrite()   → OP_ANALOG_WRITE  (0x12)
analogRead()    → OP_ANALOG_READ   (0x13)
delay()         → OP_DELAY         (0x14)

```

## QEMU Integration Research

### QEMU Capabilities
- **ARM Cortex-M4 emulation**: Stellaris LM3S6965EVB target
- **GDB debugging support**: Real-time debugging capabilities
- **Automated testing pipeline**: Scriptable execution and result capture
- **Hardware-independent development**: No physical hardware required

### Semihosting Integration
- **Debug Output**: Real-time printf functionality

## Compiler Technology Analysis

### Compiler Approach Comparison
1. **Hand-written Parser**
   - **Pros**: Full control, KISS compliance, minimal dependencies
   - **Cons**: More development time, potential parsing bugs
   - **Best for**: Limited feature set (5 Arduino functions MVP)

2. **LLVM/GCC Backend**
   - **Pros**: Robust parsing, optimization capabilities
   - **Cons**: Complex integration, large dependencies
   - **Best for**: Full C language support (post-MVP)

3. **ANTLR Grammar**
   - **Pros**: Professional parsing, extensible, maintainable
   - **Cons**: Learning curve, additional dependency
   - **Best for**: Structured growth beyond MVP (Phase 3 choice)

### Compiler Decision Evolution
- **Initial MVP**: Hand-written minimal parser (KISS principle)
- **Phase 3 Final**: ANTLR 4.x grammar (proven reliability + extensibility)
- **Rationale**: ANTLR provides professional quality with manageable complexity

## Testing Strategy Research

### Testing Approach Analysis
- **Manual verification per chunk**: Rapid development cycle
- **Automated QEMU execution**: Reliable regression testing
- **CI/CD-ready structure**: Prepared for post-MVP automation
- **Comprehensive coverage**: Unit + integration + end-to-end validation

### Test Infrastructure Evolution
```
Phase 1: 21 tests (VM Core)
Phase 2.1: 37 tests (VM + GPIO)
Phase 2.2: 56 tests (VM + GPIO + Button)
Phase 2.3+: 125 tests (VM + GPIO + Button + Arduino + C-to-bytecode)
```

## Performance Analysis

### Memory Usage Tracking
```
Phase 1: 6,640 bytes flash, 24 bytes RAM
Phase 2.1: 15,704 bytes flash, 188 bytes RAM
Phase 2.3+: 24,784 bytes flash, 200 bytes RAM + 8KB VM
```

### Performance Targets
- **VM Overhead**: 5-10% target (achieved in software bounds checking)
- **Memory Efficiency**: <20% of 128KB flash (achieved: 18.9%)
- **Test Coverage**: 100% pass rate maintained throughout

## Deferred Research Areas

### Features Analyzed but Deferred
- **IPC between processes**: Complex, not required for MVP
- **Version matching system**: Useful but not critical for proof-of-concept
- **Resource/peripheral contention**: Post-MVP complexity
