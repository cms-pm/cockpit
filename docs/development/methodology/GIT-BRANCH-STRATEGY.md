# Git Branch Strategy and Missing Branch Documentation

## Current Status

**Last Comprehensive Commit**: `feb1c23` - Phase 2.2-2.3.1: Arduino Input System + Function Integration

## Missing Branch Points (Documented for Reference)

Due to overlapping file modifications, the following development chunks were combined into a single commit. For historical reference, here are the missing branch points:

### **Missing Branch: `phase-2.2-button-input`**
**Would have included** (from commit `519a56d` base):
- `lib/button_input/` - Complete button input system
- `src/test_button_input.c` - Button tests
- `src/test_gpio_common.h` - Shared test infrastructure
- `src/test_qemu_gpio.c` - QEMU-compatible GPIO tests
- `lib/arduino_hal/arduino_hal.c` - HAL mock layer (lines 143-171)
- `lib/vm_core/vm_core.h` - OP_BUTTON_PRESSED, OP_BUTTON_RELEASED opcodes only
- `lib/vm_core/vm_core.c` - Button opcode implementations only
- `platformio.ini` - TESTING define
- Test framework restructuring

### **Missing Branch: `phase-2.3.1-timing-functions`**  
**Would have included** (from Phase 2.2 base):
- `lib/vm_core/vm_core.h` - OP_PIN_MODE, OP_MILLIS, OP_MICROS opcodes
- `lib/vm_core/vm_core.c` - pinMode and timing opcode implementations
- `src/test_arduino_functions.c` - Arduino function tests
- `src/main.c` - Test integration updates
- Additional semihosting include

## Overlapping Files Analysis

**Files with overlapping changes**:
- `lib/vm_core/vm_core.h` - Both phases added VM opcodes
- `lib/vm_core/vm_core.c` - Both phases added opcode implementations
- `src/main.c` - Both phases added test integration
- `CLAUDE.md` - Documentation across both phases

**Resolution Strategy**: Combined commit with detailed documentation of both phases.

## Going Forward: Proper Branching

**Current Active Branch**: `phase-2.3.2-printf`

**Future Branches**:
- `phase-2.3.3-comparison-ops` - Comparison operations (OP_EQ/NE/LT/GT/LE/GE)
- `phase-2.3.4-integration-tests` - C-to-bytecode examples and validation
- `phase-2.3.5-documentation` - Final Phase 2.3 documentation updates

## Branch Naming Convention

**Format**: `phase-X.Y.Z-description`
- `X.Y` = Major phase (e.g., 2.3)
- `Z` = Chunk number (optional for sub-chunks)
- `description` = Brief feature description

**Examples**:
- `phase-2.3.2-printf` ✅
- `phase-3.1-c-parser`
- `phase-3.2-function-mapping`

## Commit Message Format

```
Phase X.Y.Z: Feature Description

- ✅ Key achievement 1
- ✅ Key achievement 2
- ✅ Test results summary
```

## Recovery Strategy

If overlapping changes occur again:
1. **Stop development** on the second chunk
2. **Commit first chunk** with proper branch
3. **Merge to main** and create second branch
4. **Continue with second chunk** from clean state

This avoids the file overlap issue while maintaining development velocity.

## Current Repository State

- **Branch**: `phase-2.3.2-printf` 
- **Base Commit**: `feb1c23`
- **Next Target**: printf() implementation with semihosting bridge
- **Missing Work**: Documented above for historical reference

*This strategy ensures proper version control while acknowledging the development reality of intertwined features.*
