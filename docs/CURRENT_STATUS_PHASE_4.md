# ComponentVM Phase 4 Current Status - Hardware Debugging Session
**Date**: July 12, 2025  
**Phase**: 4.3.3 - Hardware Validation of C++ Test Framework  
**Status**: IN PROGRESS - GDB/Hardware Execution Issue  

## üö® CURRENT DEBUGGING SITUATION

### **Problem Description**
- **Hardware**: STM32G431CB WeAct Studio CoreBoard connected via ST-Link
- **Symptom**: LED turns on for ~1.5 seconds then shuts off (should blink continuously)  
- **Root Cause**: GDB command execution issues in automated test runner

### **Critical Discovery Made**
‚ö†Ô∏è **MAJOR INSIGHT**: When automated test runner connects to GDB server via OpenOCD, program execution **HALTS IMMEDIATELY**. This was causing LED to appear "broken" when it was actually just debugger-halted.

**Key Finding**: 
- GDB connection stops target execution for debugging
- Must issue `reset` + `continue` commands before disconnecting to resume normal operation
- LED behavior during testing may be interrupted execution, not program failure

## üìç EXACT CURRENT STATE

### **What Works Successfully**
‚úÖ **Firmware Build & Upload**: All test programs compile and upload to hardware  
‚úÖ **C++ Observer Pattern**: ComponentVM C++ integration compiles without template issues  
‚úÖ **Basic Hardware Setup**: GPIO, HAL, clock configuration functional  
‚úÖ **VM Bridge Architecture**: vm_bridge C wrapper layer works  
‚úÖ **Test Infrastructure**: Automated test runner can build/upload different test programs  

### **Current Issue**
‚ùå **GDB Command Execution**: The `reset` + `continue` commands in automated test runner aren't properly resuming execution

**Specific Problem Location**: 
```python
# In scripts/hardware_testing/automated_test_runner.py lines 176-182
# Reset and continue program before stopping debug session 
# CRITICAL: This allows the program to run normally after debug session
self.debug_engine.execute_gdb_command("monitor reset")
self.debug_engine.execute_gdb_command("continue")
```

**Expected vs Actual**:
- **Expected**: LED shows continuous blink pattern indicating test results
- **Actual**: LED turns on briefly (~1.5s) then goes off (program halted)

## üîß DEBUGGING APPROACH IN PROGRESS

### **Test Program Currently Loaded**
File: `src/simple_led_test.c`  
Function: `run_simple_led_test_main()`

**Expected LED Behavior**:
1. **3 quick flashes** (100ms on/off) = Test initialization  
2. **500ms pause**
3. **Continuous pattern**:
   - **Medium blink (200ms)** = SUCCESS (VM execution worked)
   - **Fast blink (100ms)** = FAILURE (VM execution failed)

### **Next Steps to Continue Debugging**
1. **Fix GDB command execution** - The reset/continue commands aren't working properly
2. **Alternative approach**: Upload firmware without GDB connection to validate pure hardware operation
3. **Verify VM execution** - Determine if 1.5s behavior is VM execution time vs GDB timeout

## üìÇ KEY FILES MODIFIED IN THIS SESSION

### **Test Programs Created**
- `/src/simple_led_test.c` - VM bridge test with LED feedback (CURRENT)
- `/src/simple_cpp_test.cpp` - Direct C++ ComponentVM test (observer pattern)
- `/src/basic_hardware_test.c` - Hardware-only test (no VM)

### **Infrastructure Updates**
- `/scripts/hardware_testing/automated_test_runner.py` - Added GDB reset/continue logic
- `/CLAUDE.md` - Added critical GDB execution control documentation

### **Architecture Validated**
- **Observer Pattern**: ITelemetryObserver interface works on hardware
- **C++ Integration**: Direct ComponentVM instantiation successful  
- **VM Bridge**: C wrapper layer functional
- **Build System**: PlatformIO hardware compilation working

## üéØ PHASE 4.3.3 COMPLETION CRITERIA

### **What We're Trying to Validate**
- [x] C++ ComponentVM builds and links on hardware
- [x] Observer pattern integration functional  
- [ ] **VM program execution works on hardware** ‚Üê CURRENT FOCUS
- [ ] LED feedback indicates success/failure correctly
- [ ] Automated test runner properly controls hardware execution

### **Success Metrics**
- **LED Pattern Observed**: Continuous medium blink (200ms) = VM success
- **VM Operations**: Simple arithmetic program (PUSH 42, PUSH 24, ADD, HALT) executes
- **Hardware Control**: GDB session doesn't interfere with normal program operation

## üöÄ RESUME INSTRUCTIONS FOR FUTURE CLAUDE

### **To Continue This Session**
1. **Current hardware state**: STM32G431CB connected with `simple_led_test.c` firmware
2. **Problem to solve**: Fix GDB reset/continue commands or bypass GDB for validation
3. **Quick test**: Check if LED shows expected pattern after manual firmware upload
4. **Files to examine**: 
   - `scripts/hardware_testing/automated_test_runner.py` (GDB command execution)
   - `src/simple_led_test.c` (current test program)
   - Debug logs for GDB command failures

### **Alternative Validation Approaches**
- **Bypass GDB**: Upload firmware directly and observe LED without debug connection
- **Manual GDB**: Connect manually to verify reset/continue commands work
- **Simpler test**: Use `basic_hardware_test.c` for hardware-only validation (no VM)

### **Success Validation**
When working correctly, you should see:
- 3 quick LED flashes at startup
- Continuous medium/fast blink indicating VM test results
- No program halt after debug session

**STATUS**: Ready to resume GDB command debugging or try alternative validation approach  
**NEXT SESSION FOCUS**: Fix automated test runner GDB execution control or validate hardware manually
