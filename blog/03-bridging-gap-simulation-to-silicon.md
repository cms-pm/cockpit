# Bridging the Gap: From Simulation to Silicon with STM32G431CB

## Purpose:
To illustrate the critical phase of transitioning ComponentVM from QEMU simulation to actual hardware. This highlights your practical debugging, hardware integration, and validation skills.

## Prompts:
* Describe the initial challenges and "gotchas" encountered when moving ComponentVM from a simulated environment (QEMU) to the bare metal of the STM32G431CB. Provide specific examples of issues related to clocking, memory access, or peripheral initialization.
* Explain the importance and implementation of your "Dual-Pass Validation" and "Workspace-isolated testing system." How did these frameworks ensure robust hardware execution and state validation?
* Detail a specific hardware integration challenge you faced (e.g., USART1 testing, GPIO control, or SysTick configuration) and how you debugged and resolved it. What tools and methodologies were invaluable?
* Reflect on the learning curve associated with direct hardware interaction. What new skills or insights did you gain during Phase 4 (Hardware Transition)?
