# Fortifying Cockpit: Memory Protection, Testing, and Quality Assurance

## Purpose:
To emphasize your commitment to robust, reliable software through rigorous testing and defensive programming. This appeals to hiring managers concerned with code quality and system stability.

## Prompts:
* Explain the memory protection mechanisms implemented in ComponentVM (e.g., stack canaries, bounds checking, corruption detection). Why are these crucial in an embedded hypervisor, and how do they function?
* Describe the evolution of your testing framework and strategy (e.g., `TESTING_HISTORY.md`, `CANARY_PROTECTION_AND_TEST_ARCHITECTURE_EVOLUTION.md`). How did you ensure comprehensive test coverage for both VM core features and hardware interactions?
* Discuss the significance of "Phase Completion QA Reports" and how they contributed to the project's stability and your confidence in its progress.
* What were the most valuable lessons learned about building resilient embedded systems through thorough testing and proactive defect prevention?
