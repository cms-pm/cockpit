# Beyond the Bug: A Masterclass in Embedded Toolchain Debugging

## Purpose:
To showcase your advanced debugging skills and systematic approach to problem-solving in complex embedded environments, targeting the "deep technical experience" aspect. Reference specific documentation like `EMBEDDED_TOOLCHAIN_DEBUGGING_MASTERCLASS.md` and bug reports.

## Prompts:
* Recount a particularly challenging bug you encountered in the Cockpit project (e.g., the `CALL_INSTRUCTION_BUG_REPORT_AND_PC_MANAGEMENT_LEARNING.md`). Detail your diagnostic process from symptom to root cause.
* Discuss the specific debugging tools and techniques that proved most effective in an ARM Cortex-M4 environment (e.g., JTAG/SWD debuggers, GDB, OpenOCD, printf debugging, logic analyzers). How did you leverage them?
* Share insights from your "Embedded Toolchain Debugging Masterclass." What are your key takeaways or best practices for debugging complex embedded software?
* How did this debugging experience enhance your understanding of the underlying hardware, compiler behavior, or runtime environment?
