# Orchestrating Complexity: My Approach to Embedded Project Management

## Purpose:
To highlight your project management, planning, and execution skills in the context of a personal, large-scale embedded systems endeavor. This directly addresses the "managing a complex Embedded Systems project from the ground up" aspect.

## Prompts:
* Share your "Planning Methodology" (e.g., "Pool Questions Framework") and how it helped you break down the Cockpit project into manageable phases and tasks.
* Discuss your chosen "Git Branch Strategy" and its effectiveness in maintaining code integrity, facilitating parallel development (even if solo), and managing releases/milestones.
* How did you track progress, manage dependencies, and adapt to unforeseen challenges throughout the project's development lifecycle? Provide examples of how your methodology evolved.
* What are your key takeaways regarding effective project management for deeply technical, resource-constrained embedded systems projects? How do these skills translate to a team environment?
