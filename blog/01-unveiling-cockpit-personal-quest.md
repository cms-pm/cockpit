# Unveiling Cockpit: A Personal Quest into Embedded Hypervisors

## Purpose:
To introduce the project's core vision, your motivation for undertaking such a complex embedded systems project, and why an embedded hypervisor is a compelling challenge. This sets the stage for your technical journey and highlights your proactive learning approach.

## Prompts:
* What sparked your interest in building an embedded hypervisor from scratch? What problem were you aiming to solve or what knowledge gap were you trying to fill?
* Explain the fundamental concept of an embedded hypervisor (like ComponentVM) for a technical audience. What are its unique challenges and benefits compared to traditional embedded firmware or larger virtualization solutions?
* Beyond the technical, what personal and professional goals drove you to embark on the Cockpit project? How does this project reflect your learning philosophy and ambition?
* Briefly introduce the chosen hardware (STM32G431CB) and why it was a suitable platform for this ambitious endeavor.
